-- Script: create_generic_ehr_cohort.sql
-- Purpose: Creates the initial cohort of Sepsis Positive and Negative patients.
--          - Positives: Sepsis onset >= 24h after admission. Anchor = Onset - 6h.
--          - Negatives: No sepsis history. Anchor = ICU Intime + Median_Time_To_Sepsis - 6h.
--          - Note: This table may contain multiple admissions per subject.
--            Subject-level deduplication happens in a later step based on modality availability.
